An Integrated Framework for Perception of Tumbling Non–Cooperative Satellites
Pose tracking, geometric reconstruction, and motion parameter identification are of great significance to the perception of tumbling (i.e., simultaneously spin and precession) non–cooperative satellites. This paper proposes an integrated framework to perform these operations simultaneously. First, pose tracking is performed through three strategies, including adaptive weight registration, re-estimating the pose of the error tracking frames, and registration between keyframes. Second, the geometric reconstruction is performed by active surfels fusion. Specially, two types of loop closure and fixed interval frame correction trigger frequent reconstruction refinement through thinned deformation graph. Third, the tumbling parameters can be obtained by solving a set of nonlinear equations based on the relationship between the overall pose of keyframes and the tumbling motion.
